# 96 Well Data Processing

## Developed to run in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. 
Make sure that you have already completed steps under the *Baseline_Installs* folder.



## Main Workflow and Requirements

(1) SOP with code to run in jupyter
- *SOP_RRT_96Well_DataProcessing*
- You can download this SOP directly into your data folder and run it directly in jupyter to get outputs. 

(2) Aggregated data template
- *aggregated_data.xlsx*
- This is the preprocessing template with full data to analyze added. It should contain your data prior to running the SOP notebook.


## Preparation to Complete Prior to Main Workflow

(1) Experimental design template (1 plate)
- *96_well_experimental_design.xlsx*
- required for my mentees to fill out and keep on Box

(2) Example of experimental design template filled out
- *96_well_experimental_design_example.xlsx*

(3) Example of plate reader data 
- *96_well_platereader_data_example.xml*
- this is the raw file from the machine and is an XML file

(4) Aggregated data template 
- *aggregated_data.xlsx*
- This is needed to complete the analysis. Make an XLSX file, not an XML.

(5) Example of aggregated data template 
- *aggregated_data_example.xlsx*
- Each plate should have it's own aggregated data file. Even if you set up 3 plates with the same conditions, each should have its own file. 


### Analysis Output Examples 

(1) TBD

(2) TBD



## If you are someone that I am mentoring, please make sure your data repository in Box includes: 

(1) Filled out template

(2) Raw data from the plate reader

(3) Aggregated Data for analysis

(4) Any files produced from using this script
