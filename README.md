### Not Python savvy?
Some prerequisites to using these files includes knowing how to pip install packages, use jupyter notebook (suggested), and terminal. Ideally you will know basic Python grammar before using these. If you are starting from scratch, when looking at Python scripts in Jupyter Notebook the naming of DFs, the files you call in, and numbers in green are super easily changed without messing up display. Numbers in green tend to be just altering things like scales, tick spacing, subplot setups, etc. 

### Not R savvy?
Some prerequisites to using R files includes having R or R Studio (preffered) installed. R is pretty similar to Python, though one big note is that R starts array indexing at 1 which is important to note if using various scripts I upload here. Using Jupyter for R is more difficult as well, so I highly suggest coding directly in R Studio. I find the R studio to be less "clean" when debugging and re-running, so keep good notes as you work!
