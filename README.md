### Not Coding savvy?
Some prerequisites to using these files includes knowing how to install packages in multiple languages, use jupyter notebook (suggested), and use command line. Ideally you will know basic Python, R, HTML, and JavaScript before using these. 

I will very clearly mark lines that you may need or want to edit to make it work for your data. Of course you can edit more or less, especially if more experienced, but I try to make this as beginner ready to plug and chug as possible.
