# Plotly Interactive Heatmaps 

The graphics created using this Plotly (Python + HTML code) allows for easy alteration of graphics to fit different sample and mathematical requirements. Have you ever been asked to re-run the code but to add in element X and take out sample Y from analysis? Re-running code can be cumbersome, so using HTML based drop downs can help make figure curation much faster. 

### What is included in this example?
- Filtering by Sample
- Filtering by some type of qualifier (in my case, season)
- Filtering by elements
- Filtering by elemental groups (Note, must clear elements filter to add groups in) 
- Filtering by equation subset for mapping

### Prerequisites: 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic Python and HTML coding
