# Read Me for Double Y Axis Graphic
The graphics created in this file are for a generic microbiological test looking at how a certain level of chemical impacts the growth of a bacterial strain and the pH. 

###Prerequisites: 
- Knoweldge of how to use pip install 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic Python grammar structures 
- How to call in files
- Structuring your own personal data the same as the example data. Extra rows and columns should be fine. Use a CSV (AKA, only one tab per file) 

###Easy Alterations to Code: 
If you are uncomfortable with coding in Python, here are some very easy alterations you can play around with. 
- Naming of the DFs should fit the naming schematic for your own data. Make sure you change tha name across all of the code to avoid errors. 
- Numbers in green are easily changed to fit your scaling needs. Note, I do not color these greens. It is a part of the display in Jupyter. 
- Any title is easily altered.
