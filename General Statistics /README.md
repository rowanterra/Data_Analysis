### Currently Planned Uploads will Include
- Normalization

### Prerequisites 
Knowing what stats packages can be used, why it is used, when to use it, and how it is reading the data is cruicial. Most data can be run through any Python or R stats script if structured right, but it is meaningless if it was the wrong test to choose.
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic Python and R 
- Basic statistics background is majorly preffered, but tutorials online to help when deciding a stats package exist too.
